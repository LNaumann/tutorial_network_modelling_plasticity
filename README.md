# Tutorial on modelling synaptic plasticity

This tutorial teaches the basics of modelling synaptic plasticity in rate and spiking networks. It is designed for the students of Imbizo 2024.

## Outline

0. Recap on networks of neurons
1. Synapses are dynamic
2. Introduction to Brian
3. Implementing simple synaptic plasticity rules
4. Instabilities with Hebbian plasticity in recurrent networks
5. Homeostasis for the rescue (BCM rule / triplet rule)
6. Outlook
